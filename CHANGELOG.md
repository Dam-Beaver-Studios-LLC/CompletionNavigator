## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.0]

### Added

- **Auto-advancing waypoints.** `/cn auto`, or the Settings checkbox. When
  the thing you were pointed at is finished, the waypoint moves to whatever
  is worth doing next. Off by default: taking over the waypoint uninvited
  is hostile, and TomTom arrows are shared with every other addon.
  It re-points when the objective *changes*, not on a timer, because a
  waypoint that silently moves while you walk to it is worse than one that
  never moves. A slow backstop ticker covers objectives that expire rather
  than complete, such as a world quest running out while you stand still.
- **Three new tabs: Now, Warband and Remaining.** Everything added since
  0.9 was reachable only by typing, which broke this addon's own rule that
  the keyboard is the power-user path and not the required one.
  The Now tab merges world quests, live rares, capped currencies and
  unfilled weekly earning into one clickable list.
- **Exploration.** Per-zone subzone discovery, with the names of the places
  you have not been. Zones closest to finishing are surfaced first.
  `/cn exploration`, `/cn explorescan`.
- **HandyNotes provider.** Reads registered HandyNotes plugins for treasure
  and rare coordinates. It never answers quest lookups, so it cannot
  contribute wrong prerequisite data.

### Fixed

- Tab buttons ran off the edge of the window once there were more than about
  six. Tabs are a registry any module can add to, so they now wrap to a
  second row and the panel below moves down to match, rather than the window
  being widened to fit today's count.
- "1 plugins" in provider diagnostics.

### Notes

- The exploration achievement category is the only countable exploration
  data the client exposes. The map API reports which overlays you have
  revealed but never how many exist, so a true "percent explored" cannot be
  computed. Per-subzone criteria are more actionable anyway: they name the
  place you have not been.


## [0.12.0]

### Added

- **"Why isn't this 100%?"** `/cn breakdown` explains what is left in every
  category and why, with a concrete next action per line rather than a bare
  count. `/cn breakdown <category>` for one at a time.
  Percentages appear only where the denominator is trustworthy. The client
  knows how many mounts exist; nothing knows how many quests exist. Where a
  total is unknowable the addon says so and shows counts, instead of
  inventing a number that looks authoritative.
- **Currencies.** Caps and weekly earning, tracked per character.
  A capped currency is earning potential being thrown away, so it surfaces
  as a time-sensitive recommendation to go spend it. Unfilled weekly caps
  are reported because they reset whether you use them or not.
  `/cn currencies`, `/cn currencyscan`.

### Fixed

- Singular/plural agreement in breakdown output. "1 are locked to the
  opposite faction" reads as a bug even when the number is correct.


## [0.11.0]

### Added

- **Rares and treasures**, driven by the client's vignette data rather than a
  static spawn database. A vignette is the only live signal that a rare is
  actually up right now, which is the half of the question static data
  cannot answer and which goes stale every patch.
  `/cn rares` lists what is up, `/cn rare <n>` routes to it, `/cn raredb`
  summarizes everything recorded.
- Rares and treasures feed the recommendation engine as time-sensitive
  objectives, because something that is up now and dead when someone else
  finds it is exactly what the limited-time term is for.
- Everything seen is recorded permanently and account-wide, so the addon
  accumulates its own spawn database from play. It cannot go stale, because
  it comes from the live game.
- Vignettes that disappear while the player is nearby are inferred as
  cleared by that character. Recorded as inference, not asserted as fact.
- **Addon artwork.** The .toc IconTexture and the minimap button now use the
  project logo. `.\cn.ps1 icon <file.png>` regenerates `Media\Logo.tga`.

### Fixed

- `check` now verifies that the file `IconTexture` points at actually
  exists. WoW fails silently on a missing texture, so a typo produced a
  blank icon and no error anywhere.
- The minimap button verifies its texture loaded and falls back to a stock
  icon rather than rendering an invisible button.


## [0.10.0]

### Added

- **Opportunity scanner.** World quests, daily and weekly resets, and active
  world events. Urgency is scaled steeply: something with an hour left
  dominates, something with three days left barely registers.
  `/cn now` lists everything expiring, soonest first. `/cn events` lists
  active world events.
- **Warband intelligence.** `/cn warband` shows every known character with
  what each covers, plus the combined coverage across all of them.
  `/cn who <rep, recipe, title or profession> <id or name>` answers which
  character should do a given thing.
- **Candidate decorators.** Cross-cutting concerns now apply to objectives
  from modules that know nothing about them. Warband suitability is the
  first user.

### Fixed

- `limitedTimeBonus` carries the heaviest weight in the scoring formula
  (3.0) and nothing ever set it. The engine was built to prioritise
  expiring content and had no idea what expires.
- `characterSuitability` was likewise weighted and never set.
- **Migrations ran after defaults were merged**, which meant `CopyDefaults`
  had already discarded any stored value whose type no longer matched the
  default. A migration existing to read a legacy value would silently find
  nothing. Migrations now run on the raw saved data first. This affected no
  shipped migration yet; it would have broken every future one.
- Literal `|` characters in command help and usage text were eaten by the
  chat frame as escape sequences: `<factionID|name>` rendered as
  `<factionIDame>`. Every affected string now reads `<factionID or name>`.

### Notes

- Database schema is now version 2. The 1 to 2 migration creates the account
  tables the collection modules added and moves the flat minimap setting into
  its nested form, preserving the player's choice. It is idempotent and is
  covered by a test that starts from a real version 1 database.


## [0.9.0]

### Added

- **Harvesting.** Every quest you pick up or turn in now has its name, zone,
  map, coordinates and observed level recorded permanently and account-wide.
  Playing the game fills the static database. `/cn harvest` shows what has
  been collected; `/cn harvestnow` sweeps the current log.
- **Export.** `/cn export` emits harvested quests as ready-to-paste
  `Data\Quests.lua` rows, so what one player harvests can be committed and
  shipped to everyone. `/cn export all` includes quests with no coordinates.
- **AllTheThings provider.** Reads quest names, coordinates, source quests
  and level requirements from ATT when the player has it installed.
- **BtWQuests provider.** Reads quest names and prerequisite chains,
  including nested prerequisite conditions.
- **Provider registry.** External data sources are merged by priority behind
  one interface. Curated static data always outranks them, because it is the
  only source this addon ships.
- `/cn providers` reports which external addons were detected and which entry
  points resolved. `/cn lookup <questID>` asks all of them about one quest.
- `/cn why` now reports which data source produced its answer, or says
  plainly that no prerequisite data exists for that quest.

### Notes

- Third-party addon internals are not published contracts. Every provider
  access is probed and wrapped, so an ATT or BtWQuests update can make a
  provider go quiet but cannot break Completion Navigator. `/cn providers` is
  how you tell which happened.
- Prerequisites inferred from the order you completed quests are recorded
  separately, never fed to the eligibility checker, and appear in exports as
  commented suggestions for a human to confirm. Correlation is not a
  prerequisite.

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- Battle pet collection tracking, including wild/obtainable classification
  and per-species collected counts.
- Mount collection tracking with faction-lock detection, so a mount your
  current character can never use is reported as such rather than as simply
  missing.
- Toy box tracking.
- Transmog appearance progress, reported per category.
- Title tracking, stored per character so the addon can say which alt
  already earned one.
- Achievement tracking focused on near-completion: achievements within two
  criteria of finishing are surfaced and fed to the recommendation engine.
- Profession and recipe tracking, including which characters know which
  recipe.
- A Collections tab showing account-wide completion per category.
- Slash commands for every subsystem: `/cn pets`, `/cn mounts`, `/cn toys`,
  `/cn appearances`, `/cn titles`, `/cn achievements`, `/cn closest`,
  `/cn professions`, `/cn recipes`, and per-item lookups.

### Fixed

- Profession enumeration walked the five profession slots with `ipairs`,
  which stops at the first empty slot. A character without Archaeology
  silently lost Fishing and Cooking.

### Notes

- Recipe lists can only be read while a profession window is open. This is a
  client restriction. The addon captures them automatically the first time
  you open each profession and tells you which are still outstanding rather
  than reporting zero.

## [0.7.0]

### Fixed

- Quest coordinates now come from four client sources rather than one.
  `GetNextWaypoint` answers for very few quests; the map POI list covers
  ordinary ones.
- Quests with no coordinates fall back to Blizzard's own tracking arrow
  instead of refusing to navigate.

### Added

- `/cn where` and `/cn setloc` for inspecting and recording quest locations.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- Minimap button, tabbed main window, clickable objective lists, and
  keybindings.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- `/cn zone`: clusters and routes everything obtainable in the current map.

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- Quests feed the recommendation engine; `/cn go` sets waypoints.

### Fixed

- Priority profiles applied weight names to an objective-type lookup, so
  `/cn mode fastest` did nothing.
- Objectives with no known location paid no travel cost and structurally
  outranked located ones.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Reputation, Renown and Paragon tracking, scoped account-wide versus
  character-specific.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Modular rewrite with registry-based commands, events and modules.
- Source-ranked quest metadata.
- Event-driven quest discovery.
